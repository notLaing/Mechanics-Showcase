# Mechanics Showcase
(Unity) Group project, showcasing different mechanics viable for a "Hack-and-Slash" type of game. DAGD 355 - Spring 2020.
<br />
My part in this project was to create the player movement, dash/jump, and hook mechanics, as well as basic melee/ranged enemies.
<br />
<br />
The dash grants .25 seconds of invulnerability, which is on a 3 second cooldown. The dash and jump meters are tied to the same cooldown, with the idea being that the dash and jump are both "boosts" that the player would have.
<br />
<br />
The hook will either drag the first enemy hit towards the player or disappear either upon collision with a wall or after 1 second of flying, and is on a 5 second cooldown. The hook script also served as a basis for bullet scripts for ranged enemies.
<br />
<br />
I created simple particles for the regular movement, dashing/jumping, and hook chain.
